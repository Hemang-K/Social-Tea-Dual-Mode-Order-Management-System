☕ Social Tea – Dual Mode Order Management System
Social Tea is a smart and simple order management system tailored for tea stalls and small cafés, offering both digital and manual order entry modes. It streamlines the ordering process for both customers and staff, improving efficiency and reducing wait time.

🚀 Core Concept
1️⃣ Customer Self-Ordering
Customers can scan a QR code placed at the counter or on tables using their mobile phones. This opens an online menu where they can place their orders digitally — no app installation required.

2️⃣ Manager-Assisted Ordering
For customers without a smartphone, staff members or the manager can place orders on their behalf via an admin panel on the system.

All orders — whether self-placed or entered by staff — are displayed in real time on the kitchen dashboard, helping staff prioritize and serve tea efficiently.
